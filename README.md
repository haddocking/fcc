FCC Clustering Algorithm
========================

*Fraction of Common Contacts Clustering Algorithm for Protein Models from Structure Prediction Methods*

About FCC
---------

Structure prediction methods generate a large number of models of which only a fraction matches the biologically relevant structure. To identify this (near-)native model, we often employ clustering 
algorithms, based on the assumption that, in the energy landscape of every biomolecule, its native state lies in a wide basin neighboring other structurally similar states. RMSD-based clustering, the 
current method of choice, is inadequate for large multi-molecular complexes, particularly when their components are symmetric. We developed a novel clustering strategy that is based on a very 
efficient similarity measure - the fraction of common contacts. The outcome of this calculation is a number between 0 and 1, which corresponds to the fraction of residue pairs that are present in 
both the reference and the mobile complex.

Advantages of FCC clustering vs. RMSD-based clustering:
* 100-times faster on average.
* Handles symmetry by consider complexes as entities instead of collections of chains.
* Does not require atom equivalence (clusters mutants, missing loops, etc).
* Handles any molecule type (protein, DNA, RNA, carbohydrates, lipids, ligands, etc).
* Allows multiple levels of "resolution": chain-chain contacts, residue-residue contacts, residue-atom contacts, etc.

Requirements
------------

* Python 3.8+
* C/C++ Compiler

Installation
------------

Navigate to the src/ folder and issue 'make' to compile the contact programs.
Edit the Makefile if necessary (e.g. different compiler, optimization level).

Usage
------------

All scripts produce usage documentation if called without any arguments. Further,
the '-h' option produces (for Python scripts) a more detailed help with descriptions
of all available options.

For most cases, the following setup is enough:

    # Make a file list with all your PDB files
    ls *pdb > pdb.list
    
    # Ensure all PDB models have segID identifiers
    # Convert chainIDs to segIDs if necessary using scripts/pdb_chainxseg.py
    for pdb in $( cat pdb.list ); do pdb_chainxseg.py $pdb > temp; mv temp $pdb; done

    # Generate contact files for all PDB files in pdb.list
    # using 4 cores on this machine.
    python make_contacts.py -f pdb.list -n 4

    # Create a file listing the names of the contact files
    # Use file.list to maintain order in the cluster output
    sed -e 's/pdb/contacts/' pdb.list | sed -e '/^$/d' > pdb.contacts

    # Calculate the similarity matrix
    python calc_fcc_matrix.py -f pdb.contacts -o fcc_matrix.out

    # Cluster the similarity matrix using a threshold of 0.75 (75% contacts in common)
    python cluster_fcc.py fcc_matrix.out 0.75 -o clusters_0.75.out

    # Use ppretty_clusters.py to output meaningful names instead of model indexes
    python ppretty_clusters.py clusters_0.75.out pdb.list


**IMPORTANT** In `python3` branch the order of parameters in the contact executables has changed, this might break some of your scripts

```
before:
contact_fcc <pdb> <cutoff>

now:
contact_fcc <cutoff> <pdb>
```
